## üéÆ How to Customize

Personalizing this template is very easy:

1.  **Recipient's Name & Main Greeting:**
    * Open `script.js` in a text editor.
    * Edit the `recipientName` and `messageGreeting` variables at the top of the file:
        ```javascript
        const recipientName = "Alice"; // Change "Sapthesh" to the birthday person's name
        const messageGreeting = "Happy Birthday,"; // Customize the main greeting
        ```
2.  **Letter Content:**
    * Open `index.html` in a text editor.
    * Locate the `<div class="letter">` section (around line 40).
    * Modify the paragraphs (`<p>`) inside to write your custom message.
3.  **Final Wish & Signature:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * Locate the `<p class="final-wish">` and `<p class="signature">` tags within the `<div class="celebration-card">` section.
    * Edit the text to reflect your personal wishes and signature.
4.  **Background Music:**
    * If you used a different filename for your `.mp3`, open `index.html` and update the `src` attribute of the `<source>` tag within the `<audio>` element to point to your file.
